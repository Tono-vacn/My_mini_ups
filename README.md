## Additional Discussion

### 1. Startup order of services without docker

**Description:**
The docker containerization of our UPS Server project allows for the automatic startup of services in a specific order. This ensures that the backend server is up and running after the database and frontend services are initialized. If you want to run the services without docker, you can start the services in the following order:

1. Start the database service.
2. Run the django app to init all the tables.
3. Start the backend server.
4. Register users after connected to world server.

### 2. Some features to be implemented in the future

**Description:**
While our UPS Server project already offers a range of innovative features, there are additional functionalities that could be implemented in the future to further enhance the user experience and operational efficiency:

- **Real-time Parcel Tracking:** Implementing a real-time parcel tracking system that allows users to track the exact location of their parcels during transit.
- **Music Player Customization:** Providing users with the option to customize the background music player by selecting different tracks or playlists.

## Conclusion

These differentiated features not only make our UPS Server project functionally rich but also ensure that it delivers a superior user experience. The combination of a pleasant user interface with robust backend functionalities allows for a seamless integration of operations and enhanced customer interaction. Our team believes that these enhancements are pivotal in elevating the overall value of the project, setting a benchmark for future developments in similar applications.
